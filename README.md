## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a passionate software engineer with over six years of experience, I thrive on building software that solves problems. I am fascinated by the potential of AI in the software space and how we can use it to increase the velocity and quality of development. My strengths lies in crafting resiliant, well-tested code and launching applications on various platforms.

## Projects

Sep 2022 - Jul 2024 - Software Engineer - [Charles](https://www.hello-charles.com)

I watched as Charles evolved from an early-stage startup to a quickly scaling company right before my eyes. At Charles, built out a tool that automates WhatsApp conversation flows and marketing campaigns with a Canvas-based tree visualization. With conditional logic it allows users to segment customers based on specific criteria, helping brands target users based on engagement or potential value. I also worked on integrations with Shopify, Zendesk, Klaviyo, and Hubspot.
