As a passionate software engineer with over six years of experience, I thrive on building software that solves problems. I am fascinated by the potential of AI in the software space and how we can use it to increase the velocity and quality of development. My strengths lies in crafting resiliant, well-tested code and launching applications on various platforms.

## Projects

Sep 2022 - Jul 2024 - Software Engineer - [Charles](https://www.hello-charles.com)

I watched as Charles evolved from an early-stage startup to a quickly scaling company right before my eyes. At Charles, built out a tool that automates WhatsApp conversation flows and marketing campaigns with a Canvas-based tree visualization. With conditional logic it allows users to segment customers based on specific criteria, helping brands target users based on engagement or potential value. I also worked on integrations with Shopify, Zendesk, Klaviyo, and Hubspot.

Aug 2019 - Oct 2021 - Software Engineer - [Ooma](https://www.ooma.com/office/pro/)

Ooma Office is a cloud-based phone system that consists of conferencing, phone, and fax applications. My team developed a robust web app with React and Ruby on Rails for managing Ooma Office configurations and using virtual fax, video meeting, and call recording services. I worked on the frontend in a Jack-of-all-trades role where I implemented Ooma Office Pro UI, virtual fax features, and reskinning for Ooma partners.


Nov 2018 - Software Engineer - [CourseReport](https://www.coursereport.com/)

Coure Report is a site for finding and evaluating coding bootcamps. I helped build an MVP mobile app that allows users to read blog articles view schools, and directly contact the staff. The app features auto-pagination while scrolling, fuzzy search, and sort by location.
